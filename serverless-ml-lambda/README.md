# üè† Property Price Classification ‚Äî Serverless ML Deployment

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for **classifying housing prices into categories (low, medium, high)**, using a **serverless architecture** with **AWS Lambda**, **Docker**, and a modular project structure.

## Project Structure


---

## Key Features

-  Random Forest classifier to categorize property prices.
-  Preprocessing.
-  Dockerized Lambda function for serverless deployment.
-  Modular structure: clean separation of model, Lambda, and deployment logic.
